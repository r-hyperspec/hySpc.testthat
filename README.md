This package provides some addons for testthat used by **hyperSpec** and **hySpc.\***.

[Online documentation](https://r-hyperspec.github.io/hySpc.testthat/) is available via pkgdown.

**hySpc.testthat** allows to attach unit tests to  functions:

```{r}
f <- function(x) 2*x

test(f) <- function(){
  context("testing f")
  
  test_that("foo", expect (bar))
}
```

to keep test code and functional code close to each other.

Functions `test_fun()` and `unittest()` execute unit tests that are thus attached to functions.

See [tests/testthat/test_attached.R](https://github.com/r-hyperspec/hySpc.testthat/blob/master/tests/testthat/test_attached.R) for including these tests into the usual test suit executed by `devtools::test()`.
